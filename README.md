# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game meant for two players. Said players will be taking turns on a 3x3 grid where they'll place either an X or O
to get three in a row. As long as the O's or X's are lined up diagonally, horizontally and/or vertically then that player wins.



# Player Manual
Game will automatically start with Player X clicking an empty box, then Player O can place their letter down next
Players will continue to alternate
Once a player can get their letters in a row, columnm, or even diagonally, they'll win the game




# Exception
The only way there can be no winner is if there is a draw. If that happens the game will need to reset.
